# The democratization of data science education

### Sean Kross

### 2017-10-11

This is the first talk I gave to the UC San Diego Design Lab, very shortly after
starting my PhD and joining [Philip Guo](http://pgbovine.net/)'s lab. The talk 
was meant to be a
personal introduction and an overview of a 
[pre-print](https://peerj.com/preprints/3195/) featured in the PeerJ
collection [*Practical Data Science for Stats*](https://peerj.com/collections/50-practicaldatascistats/).
